# Checkpoint
Okay, so at this point, we:
1. Created an API.AI agent
2. Wrote the code to fulfill user request.

This covers the most basic functionality that API.AI offers. However, what we really want is to do an API request to Numbers API and get some interesting facts about the numbers.

Please paste the code from [here](https://github.com/atulep/actions-on-google-number-facts/blob/master/apiai/app.js) into your ```app.js``` file.

This will cover all of the fulfillment for our agent. However, we will also need to define the rest of the dialogs.

1. Please download the [NumberFacts.zip](https://github.com/atulep/actions-on-google-number-facts/tree/master/apiai).
2. Then, go to the API.AI and click a gear icon near your agent's name.
3. Go to the ```Export and Import``` tab.
4. Click ```Import from ZIP```. Choose the NumberFacts.zip.

Please checkout your agent now. It defines several more intents. Try to play around with those.
