# Develop API.AI project
In this section, we will create an API.AI project where we will specify the dialogs that our Action will support.

1. Go to API.AI website and login to your account.
2. In the upper-left corner, click "Create a new agent".
3. Name the agent as "Number Facts". Click ```Save```.

You've just created your API.AI project. Congratulations!

Click on the ```Intents``` dropdown on the left hand side of your screen. You should see two intents listed there: ```Default Welcome Intent``` and ```Default Fallback Intent```.

Click on the ```Default Welcome Intent```. Put ```Talk to Number Facts``` into ```User says``` field. Here you, typically, specify user phrases that will trigger that intent.

In the bottom of the page, check ```Use webhook``` box. This will connect our agent to the Node server we will create in the next step.
